Hi, I'm Deep. I am a software engineer based in New York City. ðŸ—½ I'm a Lehigh University alum and a graduate from the Computer Science and Business (CSB) program. I work at the intersection of computer science and finance by building software at a FinTech startup, Bread.
Previously, I worked on Fidelity's brokerage platform.
